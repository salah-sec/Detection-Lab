# SOC Malware Detection Lab using Splunk

## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a controlled SOC home lab to simulate a malware infection on a Windows endpoint and analyze the resulting security events using Splunk SIEM. The project focuses on endpoint visibility, log collection, and detection of suspicious activities within an isolated internal network, reflecting real-world SOC monitoring and investigation workflows.

### Skills Learned

- Network segmentation using internal networks to safely simulate attacks.
- Malware payload generation and delivery simulation for security testing purposes.
- Performing network reconnaissance and service enumeration using Nmap.
- Monitoring Windows endpoint activity through security and system logs.
- Collecting and analyzing logs using Splunk SIEM.
- Correlating endpoint events to identify suspicious and malicious behavior.
- Understanding the malware lifecycle from initial access to execution.
- Investigating security incidents using event timelines and log correlation.
- Applying SOC and Blue Team methodologies for detection and analysis.

### Tools Used

- Splunk SIEM – Log ingestion, correlation, searching, and security event analysis.
- Kali Linux – Attacker machine used for reconnaissance and malware delivery simulation.
- Windows 10 – Target endpoint for malware execution and security event generation.
- Nmap – Network scanning and service enumeration.
- msfvenom – Malware payload generation for simulation purposes.
- Python HTTP Server – Hosting and delivering the simulated malicious payload.
- VirtualBox / VMware – Virtualization platform for building an isolated lab environment.
- Windows Event Viewer – Reviewing and validating endpoint security logs.
